# Terraform basics

I created this repository when making my first steps with terraform. The plan is to build a collection of templates for simple tasks.

## Simple vpc with public and private subnet containing a private/public instance

In infra_test I created a simple infrastructure, with the goal to have a private instance without public IP that is still able to access the web. I created this template while struggling to connect a lambda function to the web and this helped me along the way.
